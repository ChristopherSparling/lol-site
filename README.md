# Summoner Information Display Tool
Currently the tool is inactive due to using a temporary developer API code for local testing. Were I to make this tool available online I would need to submit a proposal through official Riot Games channels, and it would most likely be denied due to its small scope. Additionally, due to the CORS-enabled server that Riot uses, even testing this website without a proper developer API code required disabling browser web security, which was a blast. 

Ultimately this project was quite enjoyable and introduced/got me familiar with some ES6 concepts like promises and the new fetch API which are both interesting. It was also my first proper integration of a 3rd Party API in one of my projects, so that was a satisfying milestone.
